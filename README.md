# Decidim::BudgetingPipeline

**NOTE: This module is built particularly for the City of Helsinki, it may not
work perfectly outside the Helsinki layout for the time being.**

A [Decidim](https://github.com/decidim/decidim) module that improves the
budgeting component's voting feature by providing a budgeting pipeline which
guides the user through the budgeting process.

The gem has been developed by [Mainio Tech](https://www.mainiotech.fi/).

Development of this gem has been sponsored by the
[City of Helsinki](https://www.hel.fi/).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "decidim-budgeting_pipeline"
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
$ bundle exec rails decidim_favorites:install:migrations
$ bundle exec rails decidim_stats:install:migrations
$ bundle exec rails decidim_budgeting_pipeline:install:migrations
$ bundle exec rails db:migrate
```

Note that when you will run these migrations in a production environment with
lots of votes, the migration can take a while because the vote records and their
(private) action log entries are created during the migration process. Please be
patient when running the migrations in such environment.

## Usage

This modifies the budgets component by adding a voting pipeline feature to it.
It focuses the user's attention to the voting action in order to simplify the
voting process for them.

In order to display the links to enter the voting booth or see the results, you
need to add the following snippet to your layout template to display the top
section at the budgets pages:

```erb
<%= yield :top if content_for?(:top) %>
```

### Developing

To start contributing to this project, first:

- Install the basic dependencies (such as Ruby and PostgreSQL)
- Clone this repository

Decidim's main repository also provides a Docker configuration file if you
prefer to use Docker instead of installing the dependencies locally on your
machine.

You can create the development app by running the following commands after
cloning this project:

```bash
$ bundle
$ DATABASE_USERNAME=<username> DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password> bundle exec rake development_app
```

Note that the database user has to have rights to create and drop a database in
order to create the dummy test app database.

Then to test how the module works in Decidim, start the development server:

```bash
$ cd development_app
$ DATABASE_USERNAME=<username> DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password> bundle exec rails s
```

In case you are using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and have the
[rbenv-vars](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-vars) plugin installed for it, you
can add the environment variables to the root directory of the project in a file
named `.rbenv-vars`. If these are defined for the environment, you can omit
defining these in the commands shown above.

#### Code Styling

Please follow the code styling defined by the different linters that ensure we
are all talking with the same language collaborating on the same project. This
project is set to follow the same rules that Decidim itself follows.

[Rubocop](https://rubocop.readthedocs.io/) linter is used for the Ruby language.

You can run the code styling checks by running the following commands from the
console:

```
$ bundle exec rubocop
```

To ease up following the style guide, you should install the plugin to your
favorite editor, such as:

- Sublime Text - [Sublime RuboCop](https://github.com/pderichs/sublime_rubocop)
- Visual Studio Code - [Rubocop for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/misogi/vscode-ruby-rubocop)

### Testing

To run the tests run the following in the gem development path:

```bash
$ bundle
$ DATABASE_USERNAME=<username> DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password> bundle exec rake test_app
$ DATABASE_USERNAME=<username> DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password> bundle exec rspec
```

Note that the database user has to have rights to create and drop a database in
order to create the dummy test app database.

In case you are using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and have the
[rbenv-vars](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-vars) plugin installed for it, you
can add these environment variables to the root directory of the project in a
file named `.rbenv-vars`. In this case, you can omit defining these in the
commands shown above.

### Test code coverage

If you want to generate the code coverage report for the tests, you can use
the `SIMPLECOV=1` environment variable in the rspec command as follows:

```bash
$ SIMPLECOV=1 bundle exec rspec
```

This will generate a folder named `coverage` in the project root which contains
the code coverage report.
