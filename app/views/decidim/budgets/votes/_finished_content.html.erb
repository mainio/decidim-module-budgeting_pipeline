# This template is separated in order to allow adding conditional customized
# content to the vote finished modal that is specific to the instance. This can
# be used e.g. to display a specific message for users who have authorized with
# a specific authorization method.
#
# By default, this displays only the default content configurable from the
# component settings.
#
# In order to customize this content, copy this file into your application to
# the following folder: app/views/decidim/budgets/results
